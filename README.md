# 📚 SQL Server Practice Task – Books, Authors, and Publishers

This project is a **practice task** where I created and managed a small relational database in **SQL Server**. The goal was to understand **table creation, relationships, and joins** using **foreign keys**.

---

## 🛠️ Database Structure

The database consists of **3 main tables**:

1. **Books** – Stores book details.
2. **Authors** – Stores author information.
3. **Publishers** – Stores publisher details.

---

## 🔗 Relationships

* Each **Book** is linked to an **Author** (via `author_id` foreign key).
* Each **Book** is linked to a **Publisher** (via `publisher_id` foreign key).

This ensures **referential integrity** and demonstrates **one-to-many relationships** (one author can have many books, one publisher can publish many books).

## 📝 SQL Concepts Practiced

* ✅ Creating tables with **primary keys** and **foreign keys**
* ✅ Establishing **one-to-many relationships**
* ✅ Writing **JOIN queries** to fetch combined data from multiple tables
* ✅ Understanding relational database design principles

## 🚀 Purpose

This was built as a **practice project** to strengthen my **SQL Server skills**, focusing on **database design, foreign keys, and joins**.

Do you want me to also write a **short LinkedIn/Instagram caption** for posting this project (like we did for your other projects)?
